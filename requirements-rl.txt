# Optional RL dependencies (NOT required for core MTBMT functionality).
#
# Install:
#   py -3 -m pip install -r requirements-rl.txt
#
# Notes:
# - On Windows with very new Python (e.g. 3.13/3.14), `ale-py` may not have prebuilt wheels yet.
#   In that case pip will try to build from source and require system deps (notably ZLIB) via CMake.
# - To keep installs smooth, we only install Atari/ALE extras when wheels are commonly available.
# - If you need Atari on newer Python, either:
#   - use Python 3.11/3.12, or
#   - install ZLIB dev libs and build tools so `ale-py` can compile.
